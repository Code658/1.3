Lucius : Honey?

Honey : What?

Lucius : Where's my super suit?

Honey : What?

Lucius : WHERE - IS - MY - SUPER SUIT?

Honey : I, uh, put it away!

[helicopter explodes outside] 

Lucius : *Where*?

Honey : *Why* do you *need* to know?

Lucius : I need it!

[Lucius rummages through another room in his condo] 

Honey : Uh-uh! Don't you think about running off doing no derring-do! We've been planning this dinner for two months!

Lucius : The public is in danger!

Honey : My evening's in danger!

Lucius : YOU TELL ME WHERE MY SUIT IS, WOMAN! We are talking about the greater good!

Honey : 'Greater good?' I am your wife! I'm the greatest *good* you are ever gonna get!
